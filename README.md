# Project 2 (Interactive Frontend Website)
This is the milestone project from the Interactive Frontend Design module for CodeInstitute. This site uses interactive data from the Football Premier League 2017/18 season
to allow fans to know how their team compared to others throughout the season.

The site can be located at https://nathenjohns.github.io/project-two/

## Deployment and Testing
Testing for this project was kept within the Code Editor (Cloud9) and when deployed on Google Chrome using their dev tools.
As the code is interactive and requires Javascript, dev tools on Google Chrome was used to work and test functionality and the Console (using Console Log) within the code was used
to see if the progam ran into errors. There was regular use of trial and error.

Other programming languages were not required.

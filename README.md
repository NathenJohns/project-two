# Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. d3
5. dc

# Testing
Testing for this project was kept within the Code Editor (Cloud9) and when deployed on Google Chrome using their dev tools.

As the code is interactive and requires Javascript, dev tools on Google Chrome was used to work and test functionality and the Console (using Console Log) within the code was used
to see if the progam ran into errors. There was regular use of trial and error.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

However, due to the use of D3 and DC full responsiveness is not possible on mobile devices but was implemented where possible.
